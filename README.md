Inspired by (and largely based on), the excellent [CSS Grid
Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) spec.

## Getting Started

All the terminology used in this library is shared with the CSS Grid Layout
spec. If you ºre unfamiliar, I recommend taking a look at [MDN ºs glossary of grid
terms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout#Glossary_entries).

For inclusion in your pubspec, see
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_layout_grid/install), or copy
the code below:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_layout_grid: ^2.0.0
```

## Example

#### Visual:

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/master/doc/images/app_layout.png"
    alt="Desktop app layout rendered using Flutter Layout Grid" height="220">
</a>

#### Code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_layout_grid/flutter_layout_grid.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: background,
      child: LayoutGrid(
        // ASCII-art named areas üî•
        areas: '''
          header header  header
          nav    content aside
          nav    content .
          footer footer  footer
        ''',
        // Concise track sizing extension methods üî•
        columnSizes: [152.px, 1.fr, 152.px],
        rowSizes: [
          112.px,
          auto,
          1.fr,
          64.px,
        ],
        // Column and row gaps! üî•
        columnGap: 12,
        rowGap: 12,
        // Handy grid placement extension methods on Widget üî•
        children: [
          Header().inGridArea('header'),
          Navigation().inGridArea('nav'),
          Content().inGridArea('content'),
          Aside().inGridArea('aside'),
          Footer().inGridArea('footer'),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example is available at
[`example/app_layout.dart`](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/tree/main/example/lib/app_layout.dart).

For a similar example that includes responsive behavior, check out
[`example/responsive_app_layout.dart`](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/tree/main/example/lib/responsive_app_layout.dart).

## Sizing of Columns and Rows

The sizes of the grid ºs columns and rows are set using
`LayoutGrid.columnSizes` and `LayoutGrid.rowSizes`.

Here ºs what a 4‚®â3 grid might look like (4 columns, 3 rows):

```dart
LayoutGrid(
  columnSizes: [4.5.fr, 100.px, auto, 1.fr],
  rowSizes: [
    auto,
    100.px,
    1.fr,
  ],
)
```

Each element of `columnSizes` and `rowSizes` represents the function used to
size a column or row (collectively known as **"track sizes"**).

There are currently three way to size rows and columns:

| Class Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                      | Usage                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FixedTrackSize`            | Occupies a specific number of pixels on an axis                                                                                                  | `FixedTrackSize(64)`<br>`fixed(64)`<br>`64.px`           |
| `FlexibleSizeTrack`         | Fills remaining space after the initial layout has completed                                                                                     | `FlexibleTrackSize(1.5)`<br>`flexible(1.5)`<br>`1.5.fr`  |
| `IntrinsicContentTrackSize` | Sized to contain its items º contents. Will also expand to fill available space, once `FlexibleTrackSize` tracks have been given the opportunity. | `IntrinsicContentTrackSize()`<br>`intrinsic()`<br>`auto` |

Technically, you can also define your own, but probably shouldn ºt as the API
will likely be evolving as I tackle
([#25](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/issues/25))
([`minmax()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax)
support).

## Naming areas of the grid

A grid ºs rows and columns can be sliced into areas ‚Äî rectangular regions
containing one or more grid cells. These areas can be named (_optionally_), and
used to place grid ºs children. The areas are named using an ASCII-art string
provided to the `areas` parameter.

```dart
LayoutGrid(
  areas: '''
    header header
    nav    content
    footer footer
  ''',
  // ...
)
```

> Note: We use the same format as CSS ºs
> [`grid-template-areas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas),
> except we use a multiline string.

If an `areas` argument has been provided to a grid, you must specify the same
number of sizes using `columnSizes` and `rowSizes` elements. For the example
above:

```dart
LayoutGrid(
  areas: '''
    header header
    nav    content
    footer footer
  ''',
  // 2 columns, 3 rows, just like the areas string
  columnSizes: [
    auto, // contributes width to [nav, header, footer]
    1.fr, // contributes width to [content, header, footer]
  ],
  rowSizes: [
    96.px, // contributes height to [header]
    1.fr,  // contributes height to [nav, content]
    72.px, // contributes height to [footer]
  ],
  children: [
    // ...
  ],
)
```

Grid children can be assigned to named areas using the `NamedAreaGridPlacement`
widget. For more information, see [assigning the child to a named
area](#child-placement-in-named-areas).

## Positioning child widgets in the `LayoutGrid`

Once you have a grid, you have to tell its `children` which rows and columns
they should occupy. There are three ways of doing this:

- [Specifying row and column indexes](#child-placement-by-row-and-column-indexes)
- [Assigning the child to a named area](#child-placement-in-named-areas)
- [Using automatic placement](#automatic-child-placement)

### Child placement by row and column indexes

A grid ºs child can be instructed to occupy a specific set of columns and rows
by using the `GridPlacement` widget.

For example, let ºs say you had a 4‚®â3 grid, and you wanted a widget to be
positioned from column 1‚Äì4 and row 0‚Äì2:

```dart
LayoutGrid(
  columnSizes: [1.fr, 1.fr, 1.fr, 1.fr],
  rowSizes: [
    1.fr,
    1.fr,
    1.fr,
  ],
  children: [
    GridPlacement(
      columnStart: 1,
      columnSpan: 3,
      rowStart: 0,
      rowSpan: 2,
      child: MyWidget(),
    ),
    // Alternatively, an extension method on Widget is available
    MyWidget().withGridPlacement(
      columnStart: 1,
      columnSpan: 3,
      rowStart: 0,
      rowSpan: 2,
    ),
  ],
)
```

`GridPlacement` also has a super power ‚Äî all of its parameters are optional.
If, for example, you do not specify a `rowStart`, the [automatic placement
algorithm](#automatic-child-placement) will attempt to place the child in the
first vacant spot that it can find.

### Child placement in named areas

If your grid has [named areas](#naming-areas-of-the-grid) defined, you can
place children in those areas using the `NamedAreaGridPlacement` widget. For
example:

```dart
LayoutGrid(
  areas: '''
    red red blue
    red red blue
     .   .  blue
  ''',
  // Note that the number of columns and rows matches the grid above (3x3)
  columnSizes: [64.px, 64.px, 64.px],
  rowSizes: [
    64.px,
    64.px,
    64.px,
  ],
  children: [
    // Using NamedAreaGridPlacement constructor
    NamedAreaGridPlacement(
      areaName: 'red',
      child: Container(color: Colors.red),
    ),
    // Alternatively, an extension method on Widget is available
    Container(color: Colors.red).inGridArea('red'),
  ],
)
```

**NOTE:** If a `NamedAreaGridPlacement` references a named area that doesn ºt
exist, it will not be displayed in the grid. This can be helpful when switching
between responsive layouts.

### Automatic child placement

Grid children can be placed into rows and columns automatically based on partial
or non-existent placement information.

The algorithm responsible for automatic placement has several modes, selected
through the `LayoutGrid.autoPlacement` parameter. The behavior of these modes
are identical to those supported by CSS ºs grid, described [described
here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout).

#### When no placement information is provided

If a child is provided to the grid without being wrapped in a `GridPlacement` or
`NamedAreaGridPlacement`, it will be allotted a single cell (1‚®â1), and placed
into the first vacant cell in the grid.

#### When partial placement information is provided

All of the `GridPlacement` widget ºs parameters are optional. By specifying
additional positioning or spanning information with
`columnStart`/`columnSpan`/`rowStart`/`rowSpan` parameters, more
constraints are fed into the placement algorithm.

For example, if `columnStart` is provided, but not `rowStart`, the placement
algorithm will walk across the grid ºs rows until it finds a vacant area, in the
specified column, that accommodates the child.

[Read more about CSS ºs grid placement
algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout)

### Accessibility and Placement

Take note that the meaning you convey visually through placement may not be
clear when presented by assitive technologies, as Flutter defaults to exposing
information in source order.

In situations where your semantic (visual) ordering differs from ordering in the
source, the ordering can be configured via the `Semantics` widget ºs
[`sortKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/semantics/SemanticsSortKey-class.html)
parameter.

For an example of this in practice, see
[example/semantic_ordering.dart](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/tree/main/example/lib/semantic_ordering.dart).

Automatic semantic ordering is currently being explored in
[#50](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/issues/50).

## Differences from CSS Grid Layout

Things in CSS Grid Layout that are not supported:

- Negative row/column starts/ends. In CSS, these values refer to positions
  relative to the end of a grid ºs axis. Handy, but we ºre not there yet.
  ([#5](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/issues/5))
- Any cells outside of the explicit grid. If an item is placed outside of the
  area defined by your template rows/columns, we will throw an error. Support
  for automatic addition of rows and columns to accommodate out of bound items
  is being considered.
  ([#7](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/issues/7))
- minmax(), percentages, aspect ratios track sizing
  ([#25](https://github.com/shyndman/flutter_layout_grid/issues/25))

Differences:

- In `flutter_layout_grid`, flexible tracks do not account for their content ºs
  base sizes as they do in CSS. It ºs expensive to measure, and I opted for
  speed.
- Flexible tracks whose flex factors sum to < 1

## Roadmap

- [x] Tests! (we now have a decent suite going)
- [x] Named template areas, for friendlier item placement
- [ ] Improved track sizing, including minimum/maximums and aspect ratios
- [ ] The ability to specify row and column gaps at specific line locations via
      a delegate
- [ ] Implicit grid support (automatic growth along an axis as children are
      added)
- [x] Performance improvements, as soon as I can get this profiler running(!!!)
