  [@klondikedragon](https://github.com/klondikedragon))
* Upgrade flutter_lints to 2.0.0, and fix newly found issues

## [1.0.6]

  point.

## [1.0.5]
* Migrate project to use flutter_lints, courtesy of @domesticmouse

## [1.0.2]
* Improve a class comment

## [1.0.1]

## [1.0.0]
Although there's more I want to add, the library is solid enough. It's time to
mark this thing as 1.0.

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.6]
* Make RenderLayoutGrid.lastGridSizing a public field

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.5]
* Reorganize example project

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.4]
* Improve performance of periodic table example

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.3]
* Update Scrabble screenshot to follow game rules (middle square must be
  occupied)

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.2]
* Add hashCode to TrackSize subclasses

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.1]
* Fix screenshots for pub.dev

## [1.0.0-nullsafety.0]
* Full support for null-safety
* Replacement of templateColumnSizes and templateRowSizes with columnSizes and
  rowSizes

## [0.11.0]
* Tons of bug fixes in track sizing
* Documentation overhaul
* Performance improvements (should now lay out far less frequently)
* Helpers and extension methods for row/column sizing
* New Scrabble example
* More tests

Sorry, but I had to break semver with this release. Check out
`1.0.0-nullsafety.0` for the null-safe version.

## [0.10.5]
* Remove the use of extension methods

## [0.10.4]
* Massive overhaul in layout algorithm, fixing a number of serious issues
* Debug painting support, where tracks and gaps are drawn differently
* Child overflow indicators
* Debug printing, behind a flag
* Cool new periodic table example

Technically, some of these changes are breaking from an API perspective, but
I think that it's unlikely that people run into them. I originally wanted to
publish under a new minor version, but `pub publish` is giving me issues because
of my nullsafe prerelease.
